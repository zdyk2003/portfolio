					<p>My name is Zoe and I am a fullstack web developer starting her career in web development.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I bring experience working in customer service, showing leadership and providing professional services to clients. I have worked with all types of people. The fearful, the joyful, the grumpy and the difficult. I try to find a way to work with them all. I work well on my own but also work well in a group environment. I can lead and organize projects and enjoy the process of putting things together. I have experience working in a time sensitive/stressful environment, the ability to analyze situations to develop a plan to reach a successful outcome and I have excellent listening skills. </p>
					<br> 
					<p>I like to create things and I am intrigued with how things work behind the scenes.  What happened before the final project was completed? How did the project get to where it is today? These are the things I want to know and be a part of. My coding skills have come a long way since my blogspot blog did 10 years ago!  
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>When I'm not creating, I love the outdoors (skiing, hiking and running.) I enjoy eating out, working out, and being with my family. I'm also a HUGE fan of my dachshunds George and Axl.
